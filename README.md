# Word-embeddings-for-clinical-dataset-A-comparison
Data analysis for word embeddings for clinical data created using GloVe, word2vec and clinical BERT pre trained embeddings.
The current code is a work in progress, it includes, cleaning the data, building word embeddings using CountVectorizer, Word2Vec and ClinicalBert and looking at similar words amongst the final corpus. While doing so, Visualization of Word2Vec model have been created which provides a better view on the work.
